## 📖 Overview
This repository serves as a **personal archive** for my journey in learning Flutter and Dart.
As a Software Engineer transitioning from a **VB.NET & Java** background, I use this space to experiment with code, understand the declarative UI paradigm, and build best practices for mobile development.

## 📂 Repository Structure
The code in this repository is organized by **topic and complexity**.
Each directory represents a specific concept or a mini-project.

> **Note:** Please check the source code folders for the most recent updates and examples.

## 💡 Topics Covered
I am continuously adding examples related to the following core concepts:

* **Dart Fundamentals:** Syntax, OOP, and Asynchronous Programming (Futures/Streams).
* **Flutter UI:** Widget trees, Layouts (Row/Column/Stack), and Responsive Design.
* **State Management:** Managing app state efficiently (e.g., Provider, Riverpod, Bloc).
* **Networking:** API integration using packages like `http` or `dio`.
* **Architecture:** Exploring clean architecture and MVVM patterns.
