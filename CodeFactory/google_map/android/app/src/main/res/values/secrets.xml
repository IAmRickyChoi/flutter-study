    In order to run this project, you must create this file and provide your own
    Google Maps API key.

    1. Create a file named `secrets.xml` in the `android/app/src/main/res/values` directory.
    2. Add the following code to the file:

    <string name="google_maps_key">YOUR_API_KEY</string>

    3. Replace "YOUR_API_KEY" with your actual Google Maps API key.

    This file is included in the .gitignore file, so it will not be checked into
    version control.

    <string name="google_maps_key">YOUR_API_KEY_HERE</string>
